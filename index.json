This is to be followed if JDK is not installed already. Check Java version in terminal by typing java -version. You will get an error message, if Java is not installed already. To install Java Development Kit type the following in terminal sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre if Java is already installed, you will get the output something like this openjdk version \"11.0.7\" 2020-04-14 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.7+10-post-Ubuntu-3ubuntu1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.7+10-post-Ubuntu-3ubuntu1, mixed mode, sharing) You need to know the installed path of Java and the versions installed. Type the following command to know those. sudo update-alternatives --config java the result might look like this if you have more than one version, in such case you need to select the compatible version of JDK. There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java). Selection Path Priority Status ------------------------------------------------------------ * 0 /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1111 auto mode 1 /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1111 manual mode 2 /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java 1081 manual mode Press \u003center\u003e to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: if you have only one version of Java Installed, you will get the following message. There is only one alternative in link group java (providing /usr/bin/java): /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java Nothing to configure.

So, create a file jdk.sh in the path by sudo touch /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh. Then open the file with elevated permission (sudo). you may use any of your favourite text editors. I used xed in Linux Mint. sudo xed /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh Paste the following in the file and save it. The JAVA_HOME line should represent where the Java is installed. JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin export JAVA_HOME export JRE_HOME export PATH Note The $JAVA_HOME path should be equal to the path where Java is installed, the same that you got to know in the previous step. Close the text editor and give execute permission to the file by sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh. Then close all applications and logout and login back. Check echo $JAVA_HOME. You should be seeing the java home.
