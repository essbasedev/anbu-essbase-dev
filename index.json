If new versions are installed it has to be downgraded to Java 8. If you have a latest version download Java 8. sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre Then sudo update-alternatives --config java the result might look like this: There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java). Selection Path Priority Status ------------------------------------------------------------ * 0 /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1111 auto mode 1 /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1111 manual mode 2 /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java 1081 manual mode Press \u003center\u003e to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: choose the option 2 (or whichever points to Java8).

Then open the file with elevated permission (sudo). you may use any of your favourite text editors. I used xed in Linux Mint sudo xed /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh Paste the following in the file and save it. The JAVA_HOME line should represent where the Java8 is installed. JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin export JAVA_HOME export JRE_HOME export PATH once you close the text editor give execute permission to the file sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh.
